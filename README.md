## Database Migrations

Invo uses Prisma for local development and Supabase in production. To keep the databases in sync, we have several migration scripts:

- `npm run db:deploy` - Deploy Prisma schema changes to the local database
- `node migrate-to-supabase.js` - Migrate the basic schema to Supabase
- `node sync-schema-migration.js` - Sync additional fields to Supabase
- `node migrate-pos-tables.js` - Migrate POS tables to Supabase

When adding new POS tables or modifying existing ones, make sure to run the appropriate migration scripts.

## Deployment

- **Netlify**: The repository includes a `netlify.toml` that installs `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` and publishes the `.next` build output. Set the Netlify build command to `npm run build` (default) and ensure environment variables like `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` are configured. The plugin handles routing so marketing and dashboard routes resolve correctly.
