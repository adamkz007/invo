# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "invo")
4. Optionally add a description
5. Choose if you want your repository to be public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license file as we already have these
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will display a page with instructions. Follow the "push an existing repository from the command line" section.

Run these commands in your terminal (replace the URL with your actual repository URL):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/invo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify deployment

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your project files now uploaded
3. Your README.md will be displayed on the main page

## 4. Setting up GitHub Pages (optional)

If you want to deploy your Next.js application to GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
3. Set up GitHub Pages from the main branch
4. You'll need to add a GitHub workflow file for Next.js deployment

Note: For production use, it's often better to deploy Next.js applications to platforms like Vercel or Netlify that have native Next.js support.
